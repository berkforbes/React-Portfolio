      "bio":"I'm Berk, a geologist turned full-stack developer. I'm naturally curious and interested in new and challenging experiences. As a geologist I mapped geologic hazards around Utah and performed subsurface investigations for geotechnical purposes. Before that, and without any prior experience, I built a one of a kind tiny house by hand. Currently I work with a good friend of mine doing custom home renovations and builds. I've always liked solving problems and writing code has opened up a whole new world of problem solving for me.",
