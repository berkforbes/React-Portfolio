# The Personal Portfolio for Berk Forbes
  
I built my portfolio using React to showcase my front-end React design skills. My aim was a website that is functional, easy to navigate, and mobile responsive. Within the webiste links to my socials are available, as well as a link to download my resume. An about me section details a bit about my life at the moment, and below that my professional and educational experience is listed along with skills and languages I am versed in. A contact form is made available in the footer along with all of my contact details.
